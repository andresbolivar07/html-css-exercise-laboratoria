    <main class="biography">

        <p><strong>Grace Brewster Hopper</strong> (née <strong>Murray</strong>; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was
            an American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="_blank">computer
                scientist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematician" target="_blank">mathematician</a>,
            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" target="_blank">United States Navy</a> <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral_(United_States)" target="_blank">rear admiral</a>.[1]
            <mark>One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer</mark>, she was a pioneer of computer
            programming who invented one of the first linkers. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of
            machine-independent programming languages, and the FLOW-MATIC <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language" target="_blank">programming
                language</a> she created using this theory was later extended to create <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL" target="_blank">COBOL</a>, an early high-level programming
            language still in use today.</p>

        <p>Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in both mathematics and mathematical physics from <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University" target="_blank">Yale University</a> and was a
            professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank">World War II</a> but was rejected
            because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves, leaving her position at Vassar. Hopper
            began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken. In
            1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I" target="_blank">UNIVAC I</a> computer. At Eckert–Mauchly
            she managed the development of one of the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL"
                target="_blank">COBOL</a> compilers. She believed that programming should be simplified with an English
            based computer programming language. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by
            computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written
            for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-0_System" target="">A-0 System</a>.[2][3][4][5] During her
            wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1. She is accredited
            with writing the first computer manual, “A Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled
            Calculator.”</p>

        <p>In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the
            release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CODASYL" target="_blank">CODASYL</a>consortium, which consulted
            Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language,
            which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. Hopper promoted use of the
            language throughout the 60s. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her
            to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation" target="_blank">Digital Equipment
                Corporation</a>, sharing her computing experiences.</p>

        <p>The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6
            "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.[6] During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from
            universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor. In 1991, she received
            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal_of_Technology_and_Innovation"
                target="_blank">National Medal of Technology</a>. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the
            Presidential Medal of Freedom by President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"
                target="_blank">Barack Obama</a>.[7]</p>
